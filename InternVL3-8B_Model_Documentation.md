## Technical Description

### Model Architecture
InternVL3-8B is an **open-source multimodal large language model (MLLM)** that uses a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Unlike traditional approaches that adapt text-only models, InternVL3 jointly acquires both visual and linguistic capabilities from diverse multimodal data and text corpora during a single training stage.

### Key Technical Features
- **Parameters:** 8 billion parameters
- **Modalities:** Vision + Language (multimodal)
- **Training Approach:** Native multimodal pre-training
- **Context Support:** Extended multimodal contexts through variable visual position encoding
- **Language Proficiency:** Maintains strong pure-language capabilities alongside multimodal understanding

## Model Capabilities

### Core Functionalities
1. **Multimodal Understanding**: Processes both images and text simultaneously
2. **Document Analysis**: Specialized for parsing structured documents, receipts, invoices, and forms
3. **Visual Question Answering**: Can answer questions about image content
4. **Text Extraction**: Extracts structured information from visual documents
5. **Cross-modal Reasoning**: Combines visual and textual information for complex analysis
6. **Tool Usage**: Supports integration with external tools and APIs
7. **GUI Agents**: Can interact with graphical user interfaces
8. **Industrial Applications**: Optimized for real-world business document processing

### Performance Benchmarks
- **AI2D**: 85.2/92.6 (diagram understanding)
- **DocVQA**: 92.7 (document visual question answering)
- **VCR**: 94.5/98.1 (visual commonsense reasoning)
- **MMMU**: Competitive performance with state-of-the-art models
- **Overall**: Matches performance of proprietary models like GPT-4V and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
